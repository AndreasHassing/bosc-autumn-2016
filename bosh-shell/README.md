## The BOSC Shell (BOSH)
> Made at the IT-University of Copenhagen with two Co-students
(Anders Edelbo Lillie and Markus Thomsen), BOSH is a (super)
simple Linux shell built in C.

See the [report PDF](BOSC-Report-GroupA.pdf) for more information.

## Future students
Do not copy our work. Not for our sake, we couldn't care less, but for your own.
Doing this exercise yielded the three of us a lot of experience, and taught us some
really awesome `C` skills.

Even looking at our solution will just make you copy the idea, and coming up with
the idea for the solution is 90% of the work.

With that being said, we wish you the best of luck, and hope that you will gain
insight by comparing your (finished) solution to ours. Feel free to PR if you find ours to
be subpar in comparison to yours :wink:.
